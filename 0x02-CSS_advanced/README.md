## Selectors, Properties, and Values

CSS selectors determine which elements in an HTML document will be styled, properties define the appearance of those elements, and values specify the characteristics of those properties.

## Block vs Inline Styling

Block-level elements occupy the full width of their container and stack vertically, while inline elements flow within the content and do not force a line break after them.

## Consistency Across Browsers

Ensuring consistency across browsers involves using CSS resets to normalize default styling differences and employing vendor prefixes for experimental or browser-specific features.

## CSS Reset

A CSS reset is a set of CSS rules that aim to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins, and font sizes of HTML elements.

## CSS Variables

CSS variables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your stylesheet. They provide more flexibility and maintainability compared to hardcoded values.

## Inline, Embedded, and External CSS

Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute, embedded CSS is included within a `<style>` tag in the HTML document, and external CSS is linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

## Grid Systems and Floats

Grid systems help to create layouts by organizing content into rows and columns. Floats are a CSS property used for positioning elements, often used in older grid systems.

## Icons: Webfonts vs SVG

Webfonts use custom font files to display icons as characters, while SVG icons are vector graphics that can scale without losing quality and offer more flexibility in styling.

## Pseudo-classes vs Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element (like `:hover` or `:active`), while pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element (like `::before` or `::after`).

## Background Gradients

Background gradients allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors in the background of an element.

## Animating Elements in CSS

CSS animations enable you to create smooth transitions and transformations for elements without using JavaScript.

## Transforming Elements (2D, 3D)

CSS transforms provide methods for rotating, scaling, skewing, and translating elements in both 2D and 3D space.

## Vendor Prefixes

Vendor prefixes are prefixes added to CSS property names to ensure compatibility with different browsers during the experimental stages of implementation.
